## What is this?

I created OpDocs as a mix of portfolio, learning tool, and brain extension. 

I work with B2B SaaS companies to optimize their business processes, build out business systems, and manage operations for their go-to-market function. 

In doing that, I write a lot of documentation every day. From how to run and operate a Partnerships program to technical Salesforce diagramming, I use documentation as an extension of my brain and refer to my own docs frequently. 

So, I created OpDocs to keep a library of some of that documentation to help my peers -- and myself.

## Some inspiration if you like this project

Creating a public-facing documentation library became interesting to me after discovering **[Gitlab's employee handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/) which is hosted on the public-facing web.** 

I mean, imagine feeling so confident in your [**Sales Territory Plan that you'd publish it for the world to see.**](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/territories/) That's pretty awesome and I wanted to emulate a similar project here.

## Want documentation like this?

I wrote a separate blog post covering the technical details of how I built this site, and why I built it this way. Read more here.
