  id2 --> id3[Send Reseller Agreement]
  id3 -- Reseller Agreement Signed --> id4[Closed Won]
  id4 --> id5[Reseller onboarding packet delivered]
{{< /mermaid >}}

### Written Process
1. Partnerships team receives a new Partnership inquiry.
2. Partnerships team creates a new Opportunity and sets Opportunity Type to 'New Reseller' and owns the closing process.
3. Owner sends Reseller Primary Contact a Reseller Agreement using DocuSign.
4. Owner marks Opportunity as Closed Won when Reseller signs agreement.
5. Salesforce automatically sends Reseller Information packet including:
   1. Reseller ID
   2. Reseller form embed code
   3. Welcome material and collateral
6. Reseller is onboarded and deals will start contributing to Partnerships KPI Dashboard.

## Closing a Reseller Opportunity

  id6 --Deal is ready for resubmission --> id3

{{< /mermaid >}}

### Written process
1. Reseller submits Deal Registration Form from their personalized welcome packet.
2. A new Opportunity is created with customer information with Type = 'New Customer - Reseller'. 
3. Opportunity owner is changed to Pending Deal Registration Queue
4. Sales Operations reviews deal criteria for accurate information, pricing, products, and adds required new customer data.
5. Opportunity is changed to Closed Won.

If Deal Registration form is inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise prevents creating the new customer:
1. Sales Operations reassigns Opportunity to Partnership Team
2. Opportunity Stage is changed to 'Rejected' and Reseller Rejected Reason is updated.
3. Sales Operations updates Opportunity Notes and Chatter to reflect issues with processing the customer.

When Partnerships has resolved Rejection reasons:
1. Partnership team reassigns Opportunity to Pending Deal Registration Queue.
2. Sales Operations is notified to reprocess opportunity.
