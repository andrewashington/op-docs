# Affiliates

## Partnerships: Creating new Affiliate Partners

### What is an affiliate partner again?

An affiliate partner is a business with a complimentary offering to OpDocs that provides an opportunity to refer customers to us. 

These partners share Leads with us which we are responsible for setting demos, selling, and closing ourselves.

### I have someone interested in becoming an Affiliate Partner. What do I do?

Create an Opportunity in Salesforce and **set the Type field to 'New Partner - Affiliate'**

This will pull the Opportunity into your Partner pipeline forecast and will kick-off the Partner onboarding processes properly when you close it.
