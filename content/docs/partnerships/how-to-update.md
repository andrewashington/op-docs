## What is a Partnership anyway?

A Partnership is an agreement between our company and another company or entity. Currently, we only support 2 types of Partnership.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ“‘" text="Definition - Affiliate: An Affiliate partner shares Lead data with our sales team for us to contact, set an initial qualifying meeting, and close as business for ourselves..</a>." >}}

{{< alert icon="ðŸ“‘" text="Definition - Reseller: A Reseller partner acts as an extension of our sales team and directly markets, sells, and closes new business.</a>." >}}


## Affiliate Partners 

OpDocs might sign an agreement with an Affiliate partner because we have shared business objectives and complimentary product offerings. 

For example, an IT ticketing software company might partner to refer customers to us as a preferred vendor for Documentation Management. 

**Here's what you need to know if you're working with Affiliate leads:**
1. Treat Affiliate leads as 'hot' inbound leads. 
2. Reference the Affiliate company and Affiliate agent in the initial qualifying call for credibility.
3. Affiliate leads follow existing rules-of-engagement and qualifying criteria in order to convert.

## Reseller Partners

OpDocs works with Resellers to offer the OpDocs platform directly to their customers. 

For example, an IT ticketing company might bundle OpDocs with their software in order to provide a more complete solution for enterprise customers.
