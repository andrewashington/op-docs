## OpDocs

OpDocs is a fake B2B software company and the model company around which all of this documentation is written. 

## Why B2B Software?

This is where I'm most familiar, and I find that my peers are mostly answering questions around building business processes around recurring software products. 

## A fake company history

OpDocs was founded in 2021 and is a B2B software vendor selling Documentation Software. Generally speaking, OpDocs targets small to medium internet and software companies with fewer than 500 employees and sells a robust platform for documentation management on a per-author basis.
